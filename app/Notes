A solution to displaying the Online, Offline and All Twitch channels.
make TWO substates one for the OFFLINE channels and another for all the
STREAMING ones.
  When the the button corresponding to the respected status is clicked
react will render those channels...
  For this your going to have to make an appropriate Object
structure in order to choose the appropriate set of data individual
of the others. Additionally I'll have to figure out how render
the specific state at the time the event is clicked. This might mean
passing that certain set of data down to the channels child.
or it might mean creating different states.... Either way this may
not be the neatest or scalable solution but i suck and its the only
one i can think of at the moment.. so yeah.. get to work on it
tomorrow.
